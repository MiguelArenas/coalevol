CoalEvol generates samples of nucleotide, codon and amino acid sequences, contemporaneous or not, from populations evolved under a neutral coalescent model with a variety of evolutionary scenarios such as recombination (including recombination hotspots and intracodon recombination), migration, demographics and species/population trees. User specified trees can also be applied.

CoalEvol implements a large set of parametrical and empirical substitution models at all nucleotide, codon and amino acid levels.

To download CoalEvol I recommend use the Chrome browser. Then go to releases and click on the desired files (CoalEvol-7.3.5.zip; do not download Source code files because they only include a readme).
