`CoalEvol` generates samples of nucleotide, codon and amino acid sequences, contemporaneous or not, from populations evolved under a neutral coalescent model with a variety of evolutionary scenarios such as recombination (including recombination hotspots and intracodon recombination), migration, demographics and species/population trees. User specified trees can also be applied.

`CoalEvol` implements a large set of parametrical and empirical substitution models at all nucleotide, codon and amino acid levels.
